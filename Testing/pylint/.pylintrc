#   The DashAR Project tries to adhere to Google's style guide for Python as defined here:
#       https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html
#       https://google.github.io/styleguide/pylintrc
#
#   It is recommended if you are statically checking the source files to obtain the Google .pylintrc file first,
#   save it under "Testing\pylint\", and reference it as follows:
#
#   python -m pylint .\Source\DAS\ --rcfile=".\Testing\pylint\.pylintrc"
#
#   TODO: populate this file with pylintrc rules.
